## Architecture Flow

### 1. User Wallet

**Role**:  
The User Wallet is the central repository for managing user balances, credits, and order counts. It tracks available funds, free credits, and monitors usage against the user’s subscription plan.

**Flow**:

- **Initialization**: A wallet is created upon user registration.
- **Balance Updates**: Updates as users make transactions.
- **Order Count Tracking**: Monitors remaining orders based on the user’s subscription.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with the Pricing Service to verify sufficient funds or credits.

### 2. Pricing Service

The Pricing Service calculates the cost of orders, applies discounts, and determines the final amount to be charged.

**Flow**:

- **Cost Calculation**: Determines the total cost based on the selected plan and user data.
- **Discounts and Credits Application**: Applies eligible discounts and credits.
- **Final Amount**: Sends the final amount to the Payment System for processing.

### 3. Payment System

**Role**:  
The Payment System handles the processing of payments, including interactions with payment gateways and securing transactions.

**Flow**:

- **Payment Initiation**: Processes payments through the selected method.
- **Transaction Logging**: Logs each transaction in the Transactions Collection.
- **Auto-Debit**: Automatically debits for subscription renewals or overages.

### 4. Invoice & Billing

**Role**:  
Responsible for generating invoices after payments are processed and managing billing cycles.

**Flow**:

- **Invoice Generation**: Generates an invoice post-payment.
- **Billing Cycle Management**: Tracks billing periods and manages renewals.
- **User Access**: Users can view their invoices and billing history.

### 5. Notifications

**Role**:  
Manages notifications related to payments, subscriptions, and account activities.

**Flow**:

- **Event-Triggered Notifications**: Sends notifications based on user activity.
- **Delivery Channels**: Delivers notifications via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks the status of notifications for auditing purposes.

Centralizing user data enables efficient management of their interactions, subscriptions, and payments, ensuring seamless operation and user experience.

### 2. Plans Collection

**Purpose**:  
Defines and manages the various subscription plans available within the system, including pricing structures and feature sets.

**Justification**:  
Supporting different levels of service through flexible plan offerings allows the system to cater to diverse business models and user needs.

### 3. Subscriptions Collection

**Purpose**:  
Tracks the lifecycle of user subscriptions, capturing both active and historical data, including current plans, usage metrics, and subscription status.

**Justification**:  
Maintaining a comprehensive record of each user’s subscription history facilitates accurate billing, smooth renewals, and efficient customer support.

### 4. Transactions Collection
